# Toy OS written for fun

This is an OS written as part of my twitch stream. See development live at https://twitch.tv/sphaerophoria or on youtube at https://youtube.com/@sphaerophoria.

The current goal is to get to the point where we can observe the network stack working correctly, and maybe use this as a bare metal chat bot or something.

## Current state
* OS can boot and write to the screen in QEMU.
